# RomanNum

The aim of this project is to build a roman number converter that will help further my understanding of coding in a functional programming language in this case elixir.

My solution involves the use of recursion and `[ head | tail ]` a function that seperates a map into the largest number and then the rest of the map. The function keeps breaking down the function until it pattern matches 0. It then returns the result and is printed out to the terminal.
